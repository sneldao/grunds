## Log

### 2026-09-05 - working tree
Built the first playable vertical slice of the floor. `grunds/ingest.py` parses
the 26.5k-row café export into a 5-minute wave schedule (173 ticks, 3,775 spawn
buckets) tagged by zone and cohort, and extracts the planted signals (matcha
139→683/wk, loaf 148→40 peak-to-end, 8.6% cake attach) — verified against the
data. `grunds/spatial.py` serves the Three.js floor at localhost:8787 with a
schedule API. `web/index.html` renders four zones with cohort-colored patrons,
counter queue heat, the pre-batch and reprice levers, a till/balk scoreboard,
a read hint at 12:00, gossip bubbles that drift to the nearest served patron,
and a day reset. Three.js is vendored locally so the demo needs no internet.
No Convex code yet.

### 2026-09-05 - 889f770
Added the pre-commit tooling gate: gitleaks secrets scan with a custom ruleset
(`.gitleaks.toml`, default rules plus OpenAI-style and Convex-key patterns), ruff
lint on staged Python files, and a dependency-free fallback scanner
(`tools/secret_scan.py`) for machines without gitleaks. Verified the hook blocks a
planted fake key and passes a clean commit. Started the hackathon build log
(`hackathon.md`) and committed the project-local hackathon skill. No Convex code yet.

### 2026-09-05 - 595be8b
Scaffolded the Grunds Python package with module stubs for ingest, spatial, agent,
precedent, and eval, plus CLI entry points and a deterministic café sales
transformer (`transform.py`) that generates a 13-week UK café dataset
(`out/square_item_sales.csv`, ~26.5k rows) with planted demand signals. Docs
established the dual plan: a 3D spatial demo now, a persistent multiplayer Convex
app by Sept 22. No Convex code yet.

### 2026-09-05 - c82fdd0
Aligned all docs (README, ARCHITECTURE, EVAL) to The District game design: four
systems (Exchange, Regulars, Roaster's Letter, Floor), five cohorts as demand
curves, Drug Wars-inspired event deck with pity timers, and the Convex phase
deployment shape (tables, scheduled functions, live queries, AgentMail inbox).
Module docstrings updated to match. No Convex code yet.
